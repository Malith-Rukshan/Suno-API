## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

[![Example Usage Bot](https://img.shields.io/badge/Example-Telegram--BOT-0066FF?logo=probot&style=flat)](https://github.com/Malith-Rukshan/Suno-AI-BOT)

**‚ö°Ô∏è Quick Start :**
```python
from suno import Suno, ModelVersions
client = Suno(
  cookie='YOUR_COOKIE_HERE',
  model_version=ModelVersions.CHIRP_V3_5)

# Generate a song
songs = client.generate(prompt="A serene landscape", is_custom=False, wait_audio=True)

# Download generated songs
for song in songs:
    file_path = client.download(song=song)
    print(f"Song downloaded to: {file_path}")
```

### üìö Library Methods

`Suno()` <- Initializing
- <b>Arguments</b>:
  - cookie (Optional[str]): Optional. The authentication cookie for the Suno API. If not provided, it will use the cookie from the environment variable SUNO_COOKIE.
  - model_version (str): Optional. The model version to use for generating audio. Available models: `chirp-v3-5`, `chirp-v3-0`, `chirp-v2-0` default is `chirp-v3-5`. | [Detailed view](#-available-suno-ai-models)

`generate()`
- <b>Arguments</b>:
  - prompt (str): Description or lyrics for the song.
  - is_custom (bool): Determines whether to use custom lyrics (True) or a description (False).
  - tags (Optional[str]): Describes desired voice type or characteristics.
  - title (Optional[str]): Title for the generated music.
  - make_instrumental (Optional[bool]): Generates an instrumental version if True.
  - wait_audio (bool): Waits until the audio URLs are ready if True.
  - model_version (Optional[str]): The model version to use for generating audio. Defaults to the initialization value if not provided.
- <b>Returns</b>: A list of `Clip` objects containing song data with IDs.
- <b>Example:</b>
  - **By Description**
    ```python
    clips = client.generate(
      prompt="A peaceful melody reflecting a serene landscape",
      is_custom=False,
      wait_audio=True
    )
    print(clips)
    ```
  - **By Lyrics - Custom**
    ```python
    clips = client.generate(
      prompt="I found a love, for me\nDarling, just dive right in and follow my lead\nWell, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet\nOh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me...",
      tags="English men voice",
      title="Perfect by Malith-Rukshan/Suno-API",
      make_instrumental= False,
      is_custom=True,
      wait_audio=True
    )
    print(clips)
    ```
**‚úçÔ∏è Usage Note :**
  - When setting `is_custom` to `True`, ensure that the prompt parameter contains the lyrics of the song you wish to generate. Conversely, if `is_custom` is set to `False`, provide a descriptive prompt detailing the essence of the song you want.
  - When `wait_audio` is set to **True**, the request will take longer as it waits for the audio URLs to be ready. If not set, the response will return without `audio_url` but with audio IDs. In such cases, you'll need to call the **get_songs** or **get_song** method after a short interval to retrieve the response with the `audio_url` included, once the generation process is complete.

`get_songs()`
- <b>Arguments</b>:
  - <b>song_ids</b> (Optional[str]): A list of song IDs to fetch specific songs.
  - <b>page</b> (Optional[int]): The page you want to fetch.
- <b>Returns</b>:
  - <b>A list of `Clip` objects representing the retrieved songs.</b>
  - <b>Amount of songs in your library</b>
- Example:
    ```python
    songs, _ = client.get_songs(song_ids="123,456")
    print(songs)
    ```
- Note: By default you will only get around 15-20 songs per "page" of the API, so you need to iterate through the pages to get all the songs available to you.
    ```python
    songs_in_suno, songs_total = self.client.get_songs()
    page = 0
    while len(songs_in_suno) < songs_total:
      page = page + 1
      new_songs, _ = self.client.get_songs(page=page)
      for s in new_songs:
        songs_in_suno.append(s)
    ```
`set_visibility()`
- **Arguments**:
  - **song_id** (str): The ID of the song to update.
  - **is_public** (bool): A string indicating whether the song should be public (True) or private (False).
- **Returns** (bool): Status of the public visibility of the song. True if the song is public, False if private.
- **Example**:
```python
response = client.set_visibility(song_id="uuid-type-songid-1234", is_public=False)
print(response)
```

`get_credits()`
- Returns: Current billing and credits information as a `CreditsInfo` object.
- Example:
    ```python
    credits_info = client.get_credits()
    print(credits_info)
    ```

`download()`
- Arguments:
  - song (str | Clip): The song to be downloaded. This can be either the ID of the song as a string or a Clip object containing the song's metadata.
  - path (str): The directory path where the song will be saved. If not specified, defaults to "./downloads".
- Returns: str - The full filepath to the downloaded song.
- Raises:
  - TypeError: If the song argument is neither a string ID nor a Clip object.
  - Exception: If the download fails due to issues like an invalid URL or network errors.
- Example:
    ```python
    # Using a song ID
    file_path = client.download(song="uuid-type-songid-1234")
    print(f"Song downloaded to: {file_path}")

    # Using a Clip object
    clip = client.get_song("uuid-type-songid-1234")
    file_path = client.download(song=clip)
    print(f"Song downloaded to: {file_path}")
    ```
